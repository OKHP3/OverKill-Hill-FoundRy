**OverKill Hill P³ GPT Builder v01.5 — Promptchain Library**

This folder is the ordered, numbered promptchain library for the GPT Builder v01.5 workflow. It contains every discrete prompt used to construct, audit, refine, and export a Glee-fully Custom GPT — organized into seven **Merge Blocks** (A–G) plus a set of standalone **Individual Prompts** that handle specialized logic nodes.

The master table of contents lives in `00_overkill-hill-p3-gpt-builder-v01-5.md`. Every other file in this folder is a named, numbered extract from that master chain, split for modular use.

## How the Promptchain Works

The chain follows a linear, dependency-ordered sequence: each prompt declares which prompt it depends on, and the Merge Blocks group related prompts into logical phases. You run the chain by feeding each prompt (in order) into a ChatGPT conversation, carrying the accumulated output forward through each phase.

**Execution path:**

```
Merge Block A (Audit Chain Launcher — PROMPT #00–#04)
    ↓
PROMPT #05 (Chain Readiness Checkpoint)
    ↓
Merge Block E (ForgeMode Round 1 – Logic Bloom — PROMPT #06–#10)
    ↓
Merge Block F (ForgeMode Round 2 – Tone Saturation — PROMPT #11–#15)
    ↓
Merge Block G (ForgeMode Round 3 – Capability Unleasher — PROMPT #16, #19, #20)
    ↓
Merge Block B (Instruction Scaffold & PME Finalizer — PROMPT #17, #18, #28)
    ↓
Merge Block C (GPT Builder Export Bundle — PROMPT #38, #39, #41)
    ↓
Merge Block D (Ideation Recovery + Junk Drawer Audit — PROMPT #34, #35, #37, #42)
    ↓
Individual Prompts (specialized nodes, invoked as needed — see index below)
```

**PME status tags** appear throughout the prompts:
- `ACTIVE` — prompt is live and in use
- `PME_READY` — fully audited and cleared for deployment
- `ARCHIVED` — retired, preserved for lineage reference

### What Each Block Does

**Block A — Audit Chain Launcher:** Initializes the chain. Declares intent, ingests the raw GPT concept (payload), handles icon generation or upload, validates the entity structure against the canonical registry (`dataLedger_registry_v2.txt`), and establishes team-role discipline via the Glee-fully Soccer Field metaphor (Coach/Captain/Forward/Penalty Kicker).

**Block B — Instruction Scaffold & PME Finalizer:** Deploys the Platinum Twig instruction template, collects metadata for the ChatGPT Builder UI fields (description, conversation starters, capabilities), and runs a full PME canonical rewrite pass to bring the instruction block to PME_READY status.

**Block C — GPT Builder Export Bundle:** Compiles the final Builder-ready export (name, description, system instructions, conversation starters, knowledge files, model selection, capabilities). Runs a CanonSweep audit for ledger alignment. Produces the QA-verified, PME-locked output bundle.

**Block D — Ideation Recovery + Junk Drawer Audit:** Surfaces dormant or unregistered ideas from the ideation ledger, audits junk-drawer fragments for reusability, and routes recoverable material back into the active chain or into the archive.

**Block E — ForgeMode Round 1 (Logic Bloom):** Audits and expands the structural layout of the instruction block across four passes: structure and flow, skill and capability unlocking, persona and tone enforcement, and edge-case/resilience logic.

**Block F — ForgeMode Round 2 (Tone Saturation):** Applies PME compression and tone saturation passes (PROMPT #11–#15) to intensify Glee-fully voice characteristics, enforce overlay discipline, and eliminate tonal drift before finalization.

**Block G — ForgeMode Round 3 (Capability Unleasher):** Activates advanced runtime capabilities (multimodal, voice, memory, file handling), runs the tier-aware capability callout, and prepares the GPT for full-feature deployment across Free and Plus tiers.
