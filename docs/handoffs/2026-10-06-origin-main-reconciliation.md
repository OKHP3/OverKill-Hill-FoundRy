# Origin main save and reconciliation - October 6, 2026

The owner requested that all session changes be saved and committed to origin
main. A fresh inventory found the primary Windows checkout clean at
`b267575f77226abcefc704062d893545da35e432`, equal to freshly fetched
`origin/main` with zero ahead/behind. The integration checkout was clean, and its
previous head `9c532ea632173e3159f7017cadba36119d3fccad` was already incorporated
through [PR63](https://github.com/OKHP3/overkill-hill-foundry/pull/63).

All managed worktrees and prepared series clones were inventoried before any
mutation. Two stopped worker checkouts held historical uncommitted drafts. Their
exact file scopes were checked, committed on new recovery branches and pushed
without resetting, deleting, rebasing or force-pushing either history.

| Preserved work | Recovery branch | Recovery commit | Production disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A02: earlier library, page and concurrency-test draft | `recovery/foundry-stopped-a02-20261006` | [0e9593b421facfb8ca19070f4304e3a110699d94](https://github.com/OKHP3/overkill-hill-foundry/commit/0e9593b421facfb8ca19070f4304e3a110699d94) | Superseded by the reviewed concurrency implementation in PR59 and subsequent import/raw-recovery corrections. This snapshot has no new runtime certification. |
| A25: dependency-review draft and worker receipt | `recovery/foundry-stopped-a25-20261006` | [7daaa97f6cca9e6a32429203a79330f38902d9ef](https://github.com/OKHP3/overkill-hill-foundry/commit/7daaa97f6cca9e6a32429203a79330f38902d9ef) | Both draft texts are already present on main, followed by coordinator verification addenda. The current main report retains that additional evidence. |

A02's snapshot is based on `cdc8397b643821bcd2eaa5fc32a065e19cc01f2f`;
A25's is based on `6a9eac55365558612aaf1472393efc539f5a6005`. Both affected
checkouts were clean after their recovery commits. The other inventoried
checkouts were already clean. Generated caches, disposable traces and private
coordinator proof files remain preserved in their ignored locations.

The only new production change from this reconciliation is this durable receipt.
Application source, the 28-duty execution ledger and its explicit human,
authentication, independent-custody and capability-publication gates are retained.
No dependency upgrade or deferred product feature is adopted by this save request.

The integration owner runs the repository governance entry point, filename dry
run and whitespace checks, then publishes this receipt through normal protected
PR checks. The actual resulting merge, deployment and per-surface receipts are
resolved from that PR and the existing project record; no future SHA is invented
in this self-published document. Source parity and connector authentication remain
separate observations.

## Closure retry and process correction - October 6, 2026

A fresh retry confirmed PR64 merged to `40d615d8642b11b25f641e2d3bbb18ef4c9643de`,
its Pages deployment succeeded, and Windows and Replit source each matched freshly
fetched origin/main with clean working trees and zero ahead/behind. The existing
Notion project record contains the same release, all 48 finding IDs and its child
pages. Replit connector resolution still requires reauthentication; source parity
does not certify that connection. The repository governance sequence passed again.

The old A02 budget-limited draft is preserved and superseded. Repeating that
implementation or recreating its exhausted goal would not supply the missing
evidence. The closeout check reported no active goal for this calling task; it
does not remove host or account limits or retroactively measure prior gaps.

A bounded read-only review confirmed that A02/FND-43 still requires actual
assistive-technology observation. The prepared A09 checklist has no tester result.
Publication of a tested source change, delivery of the review/task packet and
completion of every product acceptance criterion remain separate claims. The
owner has been asked whether this coordinator closes with A09 retained for the
next series or waits for that real observation. No acceptance criterion is waived
and no archive is claimed while that scope clarification is pending.

The retry exposed an agent-accounting gap: supplemental read-only reviewers were
absent from the dispatch validator's overall count. The checker now includes
them and rejects duplicate reviewer identities. This review uses one additional
slot, making 15 actually used. Future A09 reuses the completed A08 worker;
its A08, A09 and A24 planned duties allocate 900,000 combined, and the full plan remains at
most 30 agents. No human test is simulated or silently dispatched by this change.

Validation: governance, filename dry run, ledger and whitespace checks pass.
Four isolated ledger probes pass: the real 15-used/30-planned roster is accepted;
31 planned agents, 31 actual agents and duplicate reviewer identity are refused.
The first probe used relative prompt paths from its temporary fixture directory
and failed on missing prompts; the harness was corrected to reference the actual
frozen prompts. No product behavior or human acceptance is inferred from these
control checks. Application source and dependency versions are unchanged.
