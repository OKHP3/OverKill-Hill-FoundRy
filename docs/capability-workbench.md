# Build a capability in FoundRy

FoundRy is the OverKill region's browser-local workshop for portable Agent Skills,
GPT conversion and host-specific plugin/connector packaging. It authors source and
plans; implementing integrations and validating their behavior remains work for
the builder. See the [product and subtree contract](portable-skill-foundry.md).

## Run it locally

Use Node 22 or newer and the pnpm 10.34.5 pin in `package.json`. With Corepack,
`corepack pnpm --version` resolves the repository's pin. If dependencies are not
installed, use `corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.

POSIX shell preview:

```bash
PORT=20023 BASE_PATH=/custom-gpt-creator/ corepack pnpm --filter @workspace/custom-gpt-creator run dev
```

PowerShell preview:

```powershell
$env:PORT = "20023"
$env:BASE_PATH = "/custom-gpt-creator/"
corepack pnpm --filter @workspace/custom-gpt-creator run dev
```

To build the same base path for production, set `NODE_ENV` as well:

```bash
PORT=20023 BASE_PATH=/custom-gpt-creator/ NODE_ENV=production corepack pnpm --filter @workspace/custom-gpt-creator run build
```

```powershell
$env:PORT = "20023"
$env:BASE_PATH = "/custom-gpt-creator/"
$env:NODE_ENV = "production"
corepack pnpm --filter @workspace/custom-gpt-creator run build
```

Open `http://localhost:20023/custom-gpt-creator/`. The workbench is the home view;
**Open legacy Custom GPT studio** opens the original nine stations at `#creator`.
The browser Back button and **Capability workbench** link return to the workbench.
Existing GPT data retains the `cgpt-workspace` key and is never migrated into a
different target automatically.

## A complete authoring journey

1. Create a capability and name its owner, version, purpose and audience. Skill is
   the default; prompt, workflow and software remain supporting source forms.
2. In **Convert & adapt**, choose a new capability, existing GPT or existing skill.
   Record source assets, behavior destinations, semantic loss and acceptance tests.
   Choose portable source, a plugin plan or a connector plan; identify target
   hosts, tool requirements and compatibility evidence or gaps.
3. Define inputs, outputs, constraints and observable acceptance criteria.
4. Write its method and components. Open Skillz and record relevant canonical
   package references, including a revision when reproducibility matters.
5. Record observed validation evidence and limitations. Review is a recorded
   human assertion, not a behavioral evaluation performed by FoundRy.
6. Inspect every generated file in Package and download the starter ZIP. Read its
   README for the target's next steps. For software, run the included starter and
   verify its behavior before extending it for your particular purpose.

Exports include `origin/source.json`, `docs/conversion.md`, an adapter packaging
plan and an explicitly unverified compatibility record. Skill exports use
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with a matching frontmatter name (source package schema 2).
Plugin/connector choices do not generate an installable host manifest, connect
accounts, fetch source repositories or run evaluations. They require a skill core
and host/tool records for structural review. Move a reviewed export into a
`capabilities/<slug>/` subtree when it is ready for repository integration.

The current application accepts the version-1 workspace and backup fixtures
listed in the [dated compatibility evidence](handoffs/2026-10-05-executable-series/evidence/backup-preservation.md).
When optional conversion fields are absent, it supplies current defaults while
preserving the fields provided by those fixtures. This does not establish
compatibility with any older application build: the tested older runtime and
downgrade behavior are unknown. Before changing application versions, preserve
the original backup and verify the exact source and target builds.

Projects autosave locally. Duplicate creates a separate draft. Delete project asks for confirmation; export a backup before removing a project you may need again. Download a
workspace backup before clearing browser data or changing devices. Import
validates the file before offering explicit replacement of the current capability
workspace. Backups and exports can contain everything you typed; keep them in a
destination appropriate to your project.

## Scope and recovery

There is no login, remote database, provider key or paid model execution. Project
text is not sent to an AI service. External source links open only when selected.
The existing app loads fonts from Google Fonts; browser storage is specific to the
origin, so localhost, Pages and Replit do not share a workspace automatically.

If browser storage is unavailable, the application warns that edits remain in
memory. Download a backup before refreshing. If stored JSON is malformed, its
original value is preserved so recovery remains possible. Before an intentional edit replaces malformed data, the raw value is retained under a browser storage key beginning `okh-capability-workspace-recovery-`. Import accepts only the
known workspace version and validates project identities, field types and size.
A backup replacement affects capability projects only, not Custom GPT projects.

Exports preserve an OverKill scope. The universe diagram communicates ownership,
not a security boundary or authentication mechanism. FoundRy supplies the initial mentor pattern for the two sibling FoundRys, and
improvements can flow in either direction (see [mentoring model](foundry-mentoring-model.md)). Skillz is the shared catalog;
this application does not install, execute or publish a selected skill remotely.
Private source release still requires the repository's graduation checks.

## Architecture

- `artifacts/mockup-sandbox/src/pages/capability-workbench.tsx`: authoring interface.
- `artifacts/mockup-sandbox/src/lib/capability-workbench.ts`: workspace validation,
  local storage, structural assessment and portable target generators.
- `artifacts/mockup-sandbox/src/App.tsx`: workbench / creator switch and existing previews.
- `artifacts/custom-gpt-creator/`: existing deployment artifact, unchanged base-path contract.

The API/DB workspace packages are not part of this browser-local authoring path.
No new backend, duplicated Skillz catalog or sibling application dependency is introduced.

## Validation

Run the repository governance sequence, the core tests and the browser journeys:

```bash
python3 scripts/governance-check.py
python3 scripts/normalize_filenames.py . --recursive --ascii-only --include-dirs
node --experimental-strip-types --test artifacts/mockup-sandbox/src/lib/capability-workbench.test.ts
corepack pnpm run typecheck
corepack pnpm --filter @workspace/custom-gpt-creator exec playwright install chromium
corepack pnpm --filter @workspace/custom-gpt-creator run test:e2e
PORT=20023 BASE_PATH=/custom-gpt-creator/ NODE_ENV=production corepack pnpm --filter @workspace/custom-gpt-creator run build
```

See the implementation plan for the dated acceptance record. Tests of the
workbench do not establish production quality of arbitrary user-authored outputs.
